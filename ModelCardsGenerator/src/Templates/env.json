    "main_filler": "# Use this file to integrate your Model Card\n## How to use\n1. Each Model Card to be integrated should be specified with the command `integrate _model name_`, where _model name_ is the name of the model you want to create documentation. This command can be repeated each time you want to integrate a new Model Card.\n\n2. Under this command, list the files to be included in that specific Model Card. Each file should be indicated on a new line and should be preceded by `/`. Files must be located in the directory _/ModelCardGenerator/Data_. The files listed under each Model Card will be integrated into the final document in the order they appear. Ensure they are arranged in the desired sequence.\n\nHere an example:\n```\nintegrate KNN\n    /introduction.md\n    /details.md\n    /intended_usage.md\n\nintegrate Random Forest\n    /overview.md\n    /how_tu_use.md\n    /limitations.md\n```\n## Your Commands Below\n",
